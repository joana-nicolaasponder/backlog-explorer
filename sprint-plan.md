## üß† Prompts + Iterations

### Prompt: Create Supabase Table
```
I need a Supabase SQL snippet to create a table called [table_name] with:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- text (string, not null)
- mood_tag (optional string)
- created_at (timestamp, default now)
```

### Prompt: Fetch Random Challenge in Supabase Client
```
Write a TypeScript function using `@supabase/supabase-js` to fetch a random entry from the `[table_name]` table. Return only the `text` field.
```
